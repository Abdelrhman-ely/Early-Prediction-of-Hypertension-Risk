# Early Prediction of Hypertension Risk

## Project Description
This project aims to develop a robust machine learning classification system for the **early prediction of hypertension risk (High/Low)** using a comprehensive dataset of health, demographic, and lifestyle factors such as age, gender, BMI, and blood pressure.  

The solution involves:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Comparison of multiple classification algorithms (Random Forest, Logistic Regression)  
- Deployment of the best-performing model as a **high-availability, low-latency prediction API** for potential integration into clinical or public health screening tools.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
### 1. Data Quality
- Percentage of missing values handled: 100%  
- Data accuracy after preprocessing: 95%  
- Dataset diversity (representation of different categories): 95%  

### 2. Model Performance
- Accuracy: 71.8%  
- Precision: 42%  

### 3. Deployment & Scalability
- The model can be integrated into clinical systems for initial screening.  
- Accuracy dropped slightly due to class imbalance; improved data quality is needed before large-scale deployment.  

### 4. Business Impact
- Provides a preliminary tool for early hypertension screening.  
- Assists doctors in decision-making, reduces workload, and supports early detection.
